# FraudAnalytics
This my final year master project. 

Language: Scala with PlayFramework 

Algorithm: Naive Bayesian Classifer.

Data Set: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qojmzyoyuwfnfma/AABQe9voC_FJgqUPKI15-aSOa?dl=0

DATA SET:
Ad click Data Summary: 
We used two tables provided by BuzzCity: Mobile advertising company (www.buzzcity.com) to analyse behaviour of partners and to classify fraudulent from legitimate partners.

The publisher database records the publisher's profile and comprises several fields such as  partnerid, bankaccount, address and status – “OK”, “Observation” and “Fraud”. 

The click database records the click traffic and has several fields: id, IP address, phone model, partnerid, campaign id, country, timestamp, category and referrer URL.




Challenges
 
1 Huge variation in the dimensionality of datasets: media based features, user based features, device based features and system based features. 

2 Absence of classification labels in the datasets.

3 The well known ‘Class Imbalance’ problem.

4 Continuous online learning platform for big data analytics.

5 REST API interface with asynchronous request processing of the analytics jobs.
